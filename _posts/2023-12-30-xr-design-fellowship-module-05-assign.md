### TL;DR

This month's goal was to develop a MR Fitness experience. **I focused on exercises to make people fit while in Bed (hence FitInBed). "Get out my porch" would be the first game of several - focused on games with a fitness component for people to move around within their beds. I wanted to do something for people that can't barely walk (due to muscular degeneration or inactivity after surgeries) and thus have a lot of limitations when it comes to exercising. The fact they stay in a bed without moving much leads to higher chances of respiratory infections, and thus exercises would certainly help on that regard**.

I really didn't have much time for this assignment. I was heavily focused on a job delivery and on the TUMO workshops for teenagers from ages 12-18 in game development. I mostly focused on making a quick prototype that was fun and engaging, despite its many flaws. Making it fun would also expand the game to a wider audience that maybe likes to be lying on the couch or bed.

Anyway, I think the idea has some potential and FitInBed games could actually make some sense in helping people in need and make room for people to support their loved ones remotely.

Next time, I may start with the First-person demo instead of 3rd person showing out the playthrough to allow user testing right away. In hindsight it makes sense, but only once I began making videos I realized that. Still I made a very short first person demo as you can see it in the video. 

You can see the video above, check out the ShapesXR space or read the rest for more information.


### Challenge

With the launch of Quest 3 and the upcoming Vision Pro, the promising potential of Mixed Reality has grown even more. **This month's goal was to develop a MR Fitness experience.**

We had to:
- Understand the theories of Mixed Reality and its enabling technologies.
- Familiarize ourselves with design considerations and best practices for Mixed Reality experiences.
- Develop a sense of Mixed Reality experience through low-fidelity prototyping.

In the live lecture and mentorship session:
- We learned about the applications of Mixed Reality through the lens of fitness.
- Some of the colleagues shared their Mixed Reality fitness prototypes with our top experts: [Mo Sayyar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadsayyar/) and [Paul Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pahoover/). (I wasn't able to do it due to the reasons mentioned above.) 

And after the live session and mentorship session, we had to:
- Incorporate the design techniques mentioned in the lecture into our workflow.
- Refine our Mixed Reality fitness prototype based on the insights received during the live lecture.
- Document the process and final result.


### Part 1 - Ideation and fitness exercises

The first 3 ideas I had:
- **Fitness exercises in bed for people with limited leg strength**
- Fly me to the moon: a simple game of using arm rotation exercises to fly as high as possible in a certain time frame 
- some sort of fit maze jump game (inspired in Eye of the temple puzzle game)

I ended going for the first one. It is a bit niche, but people that can't barely walk (due to muscular degeneration or inactivity after surgeries) tend to have a lot of limitations when it comes to exercising and higher chances of respiratory infections. 
Mixed Reality may also have an advantaged over Virtual Reality - people don't lose sense of their surroundings and may reduce risk of injury.

So before starting the development, I asked for help to my girlfriend Claudia (who is a physiotherapist - yay me!) and she gave me a set of exercises. In terms of technical feasibility, I discussed with [Mo Sayyar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadsayyar/) what we could do regarding leg tracking: unless we had VIVE trackers or tied controllers to each leg - leg related exercises would be tough to accomplish in conjuction with the upper core.

So due to time constraints, I focused on just a few of the upper core exercises Claudia gave me (abs and arm movement). 

![Feedback from Mo Sayyar when it comes to lower body tracking mechanism]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xr-bootcamp/xr-design-fellowship/module/05/Feedback-MoSayyar-DepthAPI-forLowerBodyTracking.png)


### Part 2 - Game plot

With the set of movements we could do from bed, and after watching *[How to design a fun and effective Fitness XR Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSBQ4RqKxSI&t=132s)* (video below), I decided to focus more on the fun aspect of the game. And a kind of dumb plot appeared in my head: 

> I have just bought a new apartment - nice, cheap, super mordern, first floor. And the only one with a major balcony. Everyone is sooo jealous! It's the first saturday I am enjoying the house, around lunch time I start to hear a swarm of birds. My balcony floor is full of crumbs - the BIRDS are coming. And yeah, James is upstairs yelling - *you know James, the all too-helpful guy who just makes things worse*. Is it going to be like this every Saturday? Somebody help me!

In sum, this abs game ***is about scaring off birds trying to eat the crumbs thrown by upstairs neighbours, and avoid James' ideas to scare them off***.

Here is the set of exercises.

{% include video id="DSBQ4RqKxSI" provider="youtube" %}


### Part 3 - Prototype

I just got a Quest 3 this month - and with ShapesXR new update - the color passthrough is super fun.
But the first challenge was how to design the game perspective in MR.

{% include video id="XimhFMCZOZw" provider="youtube" %}

Jeremy helped out on understanding how to make the passthrough with ShapesXR. And from that, the first step was thinking of the perspective from the Bed.
I started making stages of the core exercises and their representation - a minecraft dude to move the arms around, birds flying around, an umbrella, and a bucket. 

{% include gallery id="gallery-core-exercises" layout="half" caption="Third Person representations of the game" %}

While prototyping, I thought of the following things:
- The porch should be set a little bit above the knees when flexed. Unfortunately, without VIVE trackers or tied controllers to the knees, the user needs to set the porch by himself and we need to trust their decision (unless some Computer Vision AI is very good at recognizing legs and jeans).
  - For people with some limitation a caretaker should set up the porch before the game starts
- The arms should have different colors, each for a specific birdie color. This way you know which hand you should use to swat them out of the porch.
- The only exception are the big birds that require both hands to dart them away (abs crunch).
- The neighbour James makes it worse by trying to throw water to scare the birds away - but the only thing it does, it makes you and your balcony wet (and we don't want a fungi infestation). High crunches are needed to protect yourself from the water.
- I have added some arrows to reflect the movement that you need to make, but in the actual version, we would something a bit more animated/graphic.

The second stage was to make a very brief UI in Figma: Main Menu, settings and set the porch menu. 
For the porch menu, I initially thought of making the user drag the porch onto their knees - but then for fitness purposes, I realized making a calibration setup would be way more effective, with 4 stages:

1) set initial resting position while looking to the ceiling (we can actually check the device rotation to confirm if the user is looking at the ceiling)
2) while on resting position, raise both arms up, click each trigger button (the high crunch setup will be based on this + a bit more height above)
3) touch each controller on each knee and press the trigger button
4) check if everything is okay

This calibration would create the porch and set up the exercise boundaries. In the future, some computer vision algorithm should be able to recognize the knees distance from you.

In addition, for extra customization and accessibility there should be a Settings menu in the main screen (and possibly per game later on).

{% include gallery id="gallery-figma-ui" layout="half" caption="Screenshots of the Figma UI developed" %}

**For people that would have a hard time setting up the game or are too frail for it, the menu should have a local caretaker option. The local caretaker would perform this calibration before handing out the controllers and headset to the player (if they have only one device), or set from their headset and observe the players performance from a 3rd person perspective (similar to the one I did on ShapesXR in the video)**


The third stage was to make a small replica of me playing (as explained that probably should have been the 2nd stage, but it was easier for me to imagine the game from a 3rd person perspective at first). You may see the video at the header and gallery below.

{% include gallery id="gallery-first-person" layout="half" caption="First person perspective of gameplay" %}


### Part 4 - Multiplayer (not prototyped - just thought experiments)

This was just thought out. This game wouldn't probably have much a multiplayer setup. 
**What we could have are game observers (family, close friends) or "co-conspirators" to support while the person is doing their exercises.**
- Throw crumbs to increase the number of birds
- Become "James" over one or several floors
- Throw birds to the queue and decide game speed

I am unsure a leaderboard against others makes sense, but tracking your effort and sharing should be super important.

### Feedback

Once I completed the assignment, I asked for [Mo Sayyar's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadsayyar/) feedback through Linkedin. 
With his permission, I copy our converstation.
I really need to thank his availability and commitment on helping, especially after delivering the assignment past the supposed due date. 

His and [Paul's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pahoover/) work really inspired each of us to try new things.

![Feedback from Mo Sayyar on my work - part 02]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xr-bootcamp/xr-design-fellowship/module/05/mo-feedback-converstation-part02.png)

### Next steps
- Incorporate [Mo Sayyar's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadsayyar/) feedback into the game: 
  - **Calibration: Make it more fun - think of ways to improve the porch setup and its reliability**
  - Instead of a neighbour use different type of birds for a shorter learning curve (and who knows sentient AI mecha-birds)
  - Work with a trainer on other kind of exercises we can do lying down
- Issues with the Quest:
  - Develop ways to make the Quest playable lying down - this was actually a problem when testing: the Quest menus expect you to be an upright position, not lying down. Whenever I stopped testing, the menus would pop-up in very strange places.
- ShapesXR: 
  - **Iterate the First-Person demo more, instead of the 3rd person dummy - this way other people may test it out.** This was something I only realized after finishing the dummy setup.
  - Improve on MR testing using ShapesXR
- The actual game: 
  - Improve UI
  - Add timers and game counters while in-game
  - Test adding an exercise (abs exercise of touching your ankles) to clean the crumbs and water away from balcony
  - Consider if bird swat and defend from water should be 1-hit KO, or several hits with "life bars" (user testing and actual prototype is required)
  - **Actually make stages for the multiplayer setup**
- Accessibility:
  - If this game would be used in a hospital setting, a lot of more design thinking is required to make the game playable for people on serum, tubes, catheters and etc.
  - Test the game on couches seems important
  - Capture 3D data of multiple environments to scale the actual project
  - Focus on other exercises with funny game concepts


### 3rd Party Thank yous
