## 02. Module 02 - Concept Ideation and XR Storyboarding: Post-Assignment

If you haven't read yet, please check the pre-assignment as it contains this project background story - [Pre-Assignment Page](../xr-design-fellowship-module-02-pre-assign/).

For more information on the module, please check the main article [Module 02 - Concept Ideation and XR Storyboarding Overview](../xr-design-fellowship-module-02/).

### Challenge

> Based on the learnings from the live lecture, iterate and update your Smart Home XR prototype draft from the pre-assignment. Aim to create a high-quality, portfolio-worthy spatial design project that showcases your enhanced understanding and practical application of spatial design principles. **This step will demonstrate your proficiency in spatial design and transform theoretical learning into a nice portfolio piece.**

**Tools**

[ShapesXR (XR prototype environ)](http://shapes.app) and Figma (UI Web Application) for Moodboard and Storyboard [based on this template](https://figma.com/community/file/964643362660977506).

**Procedure**

I aimed to improve my pre-assignment - Virtual Bowls aka AppMarks. AppMarks are virtual locations where you can put and pull your apps in spaces where it makes sense for you and others around the house. 

These were a couple of things I looked into to improve fidelity:

- Added holonotes to debrief people to welcome and debrief people of my design
- Improved UI help notes
- Improved interactables (there was a bug with the bowl object cube I had chosen)
- Use the snapping mechanism more often to improve fidelity
- Added the case of what could happen when 2 people went to get the same app (netflix/tv controller) that only one should control.
- Added additional context to the idea (not just a bowl in the living room, but there can be bowls anywhere in locations that make sense for the user around the house, in whatever shape he wishes)

The video above is the end result of my post-assignment.

### Next steps

- Perform an actual test with gaze & pinch (I have a quest 2 so my testing was always flawed)
- Add initial app menu to click on AppMarks and start app
- Procedure to put an app back in the bowl 
- Scale buttons, and virtual bowl appropriately depending on how far the user is (using something like [Size Calculator](https://sizecalc.com))
- Test a possible direct gesture manipulation for playing (like the video below - or [click on the link](https://twitter.com/crookookoo/status/745243850667663360) if it is not working)

It is important to mind these are kind of open assignments and it is really hard to stop.

### Personal Thoughts

I can say without Eugene's video (above), I wouldn't have thought of bowls or App Marks. 
And with [Jeremy Casper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jercasper/) and [Paul Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pahoover/) from Shapes XR, I realized it is relaxing and actually fun to prototype things.
ShapesXR makes you feel like you are playing with play-doh or painting, or playing piano. 
It can be a very smoothing experience and I appreciated that a lot.

Thank you to the XR Design Fellowship team, and ShapesXR for this incredible module.
