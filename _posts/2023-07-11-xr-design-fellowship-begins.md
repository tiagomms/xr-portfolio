Welcome to my portfolio from the [XR Design Fellowship program](https://xrbootcamp.com/xr-design/)!

I don't have design experience (never used Bezel, Figma, ShapesXR), but joined the course because I want to be part of Spatial Computing revolution that is coming up.

The goal of this course is to learn how to start prototype from lower to higher fidelity. We will have case studies, live lectures with renown XR designers, assignments, and mostly share experiences with one another. 

Every wiki chapter will consist of a module with both assignments and how it is going so far. There are 12 modules, one for each month.
You can see the modules above in the header.

Disclaimer: Most notes you will read regarding the live session and module glimpses are taken or paraphrased directly from the experts that are showing us state-of-the-art XR Design or from the XR Design Fellowship team.  For me these notes are mostly a learning summary of what I have learned that month.

My main focus (besides learning, taking notes, etc) are really the assignments prototypes we need to do every month, in which I tend to get feedback from other XR Design colleagues and the experts themselves.

Hope you enjoy.
