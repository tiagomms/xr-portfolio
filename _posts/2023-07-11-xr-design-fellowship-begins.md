Welcome to my portfolio from the [XR Design Fellowship program](https://xrbootcamp.com/xr-design/)!

I don't have design experience (never used Bezel, Figma, ShapesXR), but joined the course because I want to be part of Spatial Computing revolution that is coming up.

The goal of this course is to learn how to start prototype from lower to higher fidelity. We will have case studies, live lectures with renown XR designers, assignments, and mostly share experiences with one another. 

Every wiki chapter will consist of a module with both assignments and how it is going so far. There are 12 modules, one for each month.
You can see the modules below.
