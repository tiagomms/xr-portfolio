## 02. Module 03 Post-Assignment - Worldbuilding for XR Experience: TUMO Box (Story of a Workshop Session)

You may experience the assignment in ShapesXR if you want - [click here](https://shapes.app/space/view/72a6fb6b-f2e5-4aa3-ba9c-22aa843a2fb4/7da5ez55).  

If you haven't read yet, please check the pre-assignment as it contains this project background story - [Pre-Assignment Page](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-pre-assign/).

For more information on the module, please check the main article coming soon [Module 03 - Worldbuilding for XR Experience](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03/).



### Challenge

On September 29th we had a mentorship session with this month's expert - [Don Carson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-carson-447339/). This is the feedback I received from my pre-assignment.

> Instead of focusing on the surroundings, focus more on what would happen if there is a place for TUMO Boxes for XR? How should the new TUMO boxes look like? How would people consume these experiences? This is what TUMO would be interested in.  

**With this feedback, I focused on what we can't do on TUMO Boxes right now, and could XR (and other devices) provide a means to it.** I didn't change the space, because in the pre-assignment I had already added an space that would be "empty" for interacting with XR content, to create pop-up museums or display movies in any immersive setting. 

But for the most important activities that still don't occur in TUMO Boxes (Workshops and Learning Labs) I begin to wonder if XR could help.



### Development

I thought I was doing something small first, but I realized it is a very big endeavour, and can't be done by a single person over 2 days.

Since I thought I had done most of the heavy worldbuilding work previously, I continue with my ShapesXR mockup to little by little realize the limitations of my work. But hey, that is part of the process!

The work is left unfinished but, I feel glad that I tried to help this amazing education NGO. 

#### 01 - Personas

- **Workshop/Lab Leader (WL)**: person working remotely providing the session in real-time to students
- **Students**: teenagers, ages 12-18, that live in a remote location
- **Learning Coach**: person in charge of box and checks equipment 


#### 02 - ShapesXR presentation

My whole ShapesXR pitch become: what would happen if all students, workshop leader and coach had their own XR glasses. 
- Could a workshop or lab session work if the workshop leader was remote? And how?
- How would it work for the workshop leader - what would he see? 

I entered a bit in the realms of sci-fi to realize it can't be done yet, but I decided to at least have a prototype of the vision anyway. **All the work developed was for the TUMO Boxes/ remote locations in mind, and I tried to focus a little in all personas viewpoints (students, WL leaders and coaches).**

**My aim in these 2 days was how could I make the workshop leader look like he was actually in that space able to help students one-by-one and talk to everyone. I thought how could I make it "real" (as similar as now in the TUMO centers with experts). But I didn't think what could be different - next time I hope :) .**

The entire presentation is this webpage and the ShapesXR space, which you can see [here](https://shapes.app/space/view/72a6fb6b-f2e5-4aa3-ba9c-22aa843a2fb4/7da5ez55).

Here is the story:
- students enter in the TUMO box, coach gives students the headsets (if they are tethered, then they will only put the headsets next to the computer)
- Coach beams workshop leader
- workshop leader can give the presentation in 3 styles: 
  - current virtual conference standard, 
  - immersive setting with WL hologram, many windows, skybox and models
  - mixed reality (exactly alike but students see their real surrounding)
- from a workshop leader perspective in his home: he can navigate a 3D representation of the space in which he walks, and hears 360 sound depending on location in the virtual environment;
  - when he wants to get closer to a student, he "deep dives" into that computer. Their mouse appears on the student screen to explain. In the future things like pointing in their own screen may be transfered into the students glasses as - look at where the WL is pointing 
  - he can also go back to the "TUMO box" and work from his room in a student computer
- the coach must ensure: 
  - all devices have batteries and recharged extra batteries;
  - are preferably on; 
  - clean the headsets
  - I had written that he may only need a tablet; however it makes more sense they have XR Glasses as well. Information like: battery level, seeing the WL, and other things may be important for troubleshooting

18 stages, around 10 viewpoints - it is quite a lot to detail to pass the idea. The header video is a walkthrough of the experience in ShapesXR. Below, you can see some images of this mockup.

### Next steps 

Next stage would be to work on the feasibility of every single step, and divide it in iterations as an Agile sprint.

Something I did not expand was how workshops/labs with XR glasses in immersive settings may be truly amazing and unique experiences. That first go should be tried out in workshops and labs inside TUMO centers with all technology available, people and expertise. Then, start to iteratively advance these tests on remote locations. 

I am going to ask for feedback and show to my colleagues at TUMO.

#### Equipment for Boxes (after work was completed)

Something I begin to naturally think is all equipment that may be needed and required to pull this off, since these are physical spaces and we have to naturally take into account all factors: connectivity, software, sound, image, and so forth.

- **Screen sharing**: workshop leader must have access to all screens inside the space at its attended timeslot. Students should see workshop leader's screen in one of the two wall (with XR glasses the "screen" can be projected in any place that is easier for students to read).

- **WL TelePresence**: this is one of the thorniest topics I still haven't reached an answer to. 
  - If [telepresence Robots](https://ohmnilabs.com/products/ohmni-telepresence-robot/) could "walk" around the class, wouldn't that be better than an XR Avatar? 
  - Or a Learning coach with a tablet device walking around the room, acting as WL legs? 
  - In the end: 
    - XR allows for more purposes than the other 2 - The creation of immersive environments is something really powerful and profound for learning. 
    - Telepresence robots require space that possibly the containers could not have. 
    - XR brings more freedom of movement for the WL by teleporting or "air-grabbing"
    - But for an initial stage (while XR is still developing), a tablet that can grant remote access to the student computers for the workshop leader - such an app should be doable in today's technology and was probably made already (way cheaper investment).

- **Connectivity**: if real-time conferencing with 3D model streaming is intended - WiFi6E / 5G should be required. If not, then regular WIFI should work.

But if we continued with the glasses or telepresence robot:

- **Sound**: Most XR Glasses have stereo sound. But at the end of the assignment, I realized student microphones would be an issue due to feedback. I haven't done enough research  yet, but something like this on the ceiling or in the table itself might be a great solution for the WL understand what is happening and who is speaking - [ClearOne](https://www.clearone.com/bma-360-microphone-system)

And just the glasses:

- **Student XR Glasses** for:
  - stream content and the WL avatar around the room; 
  - spatial sound - its strength is related to the location where the WL is "in the space". 
    - not noise cancelling because it is still important to hear your colleagues
  - Microphones must be switched off or removed due to feedback, as mentioned above. 
  - For learning labs/workshop sessions, which are always in front of a PC, tethered devices are ok. If we want to expand to other learning experiences, then standalone headsets make more sense. 
  - *The most important part point: students should be able to either see real PC screens without eye strain, and have the ability to flick the headset up but with the headset still operating and sending tracking and stereo sound*. 
  - optional (very basic hand tracking for the WL)
  - So far and due to its open-source nature: [Lynx R-1](https://www.lynx-r.com/) currently appears to be the best bet all-around headset for developing prototypes for this (access to cameras, handtracking and so on). It also possesses the ability the flick the headset up.

- **Tracking and Modelling**: If AR glasses without positional tracking are used by students, then tracking their position and the space becomes required (even if headsets have positional tracking, SteamVR lighthouses may help). In addition, the WL should have a 3D reconstruction of the environment in which it will navigate, hear and talk. I know there has been many advances in computer vision in this area, but haven't had time to dwell on research.

- **WL XR Glasses**: Right now, Apple VisionPro or the latest Meta Quest. Adding views and models to the virtual box space with all students should be necessary. The reason are clarity, and work with computer as well as virtual objects.

- **Coach XR Glasses**: Apple VisionPro so that students still see his/her face when working. He should also see if there is any issue with the presentation. The issue with VisionPro is it appears to have been designed as a mostly stationary device, and coaches will need to walk a lot. Something to investigate in the future.

### Conclusion

**During those 2 days, my mind went towards the idea of how a remote expert would feel real. If the opportunity is presented again, I will focus on how workshops may be different with this XR technology, instead of almost replicating the current experience with a remote expert.** 

I was quite naive when I started this - it is a really big endeavour that requires a lot of technology and study in how to do it. Any of these topics could take months/years to decide & develop.

But part of this course, and the great thing of this XR Design Fellowship is the possibility to dream what it does not exist yet. Don Carson was an excellent mentor in the process and in the little conversations we had in the class and over email.

Since this is an actual physical space, accessability, connectivity, infrastructure and human resources are all needed and thought about very carefully. And to bring an experience from the physical to the virtual world, or vice-versa it is always quite a daunting task. But very challenging and rewarding too.

In addition, **despite being Sci-Fi the future feels close.** This conversation between Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Friedman just came out. This, and project Starline from Google makes us feel that remote collaboration may actually feel "real" in the future.

I am going to ask for feedback and show to my colleagues at TUMO. 

Thank you once again to the XR Design Fellowship team, Shapes XR, my colleagues and especially Don Carson for this module!
I hope to keep looking at this from time to time, and help TUMO provide a better personalized education for teenagers.


### Side-note

My thoughts and prayers go to the people in Artsakh and Armenia in this difficult time. 

I hope that our work at TUMO may help many teenagers worldwide, and bring a light of empathy, love and dignity to every person learning and making the world a better place.
