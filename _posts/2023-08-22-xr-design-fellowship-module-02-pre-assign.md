## 01. Module 02 Pre-Assignment - Concept Ideation and XR Storyboarding: Virtual Bowls

For more information on the module, please check the main article [Module 02 - Concept Ideation and XR Storyboarding Overview](../xr-design-fellowship-module-02/).

This assignment has a part 2 - please check it out to see the final product - [Post-Assignment](../xr-design-fellowship-module-02-post-assign/)!

### Challenge

> You are an XR designer at a design agency. An IoT company just sent out an RFP requesting your team to ideate and storyboard a Smart Home XR experience that utilizes Gaze-and-pinch interactions. 

We were requested to complete the following four parts:
- Define and Research: create a prompt or problem statement
  - Watch many XR experiences
  - Create a moodboard in Figma of what inspires you
- Get familiar with ShapesXR
- Co-ideation and storyboarding: 
  - work with a colleague, discuss and brainstorm 3 ideas using the tools from ShapesXR 
  - (I couldn't work with a colleague so I brainstormed prompts in my head, picked the one I liked most and storyboarded by hand and placed it in a figma board)
- Make a low-fidelity representation of the winning idea, using ShapesXR and 3D models.

**Tools**

[ShapesXR (XR prototype environ)](http://shapes.app) and Figma (UI Web Application) for Moodboard and Storyboard [based on this template](https://figma.com/community/file/964643362660977506).

**Skills**

- First time using ShapesXR, second time using Figma.
- First time storyboarding, moodboarding.

### Discovery Process

I was fortunate to participate twice in a ShapesXR onboarding class with Jeremy, and the second time I was alone with him.
He pretty much introduced me to ShapesXR, snapping objects, tools, assets, features within the headset.
In addition, the Fellowship team provided some really cool tutorials to get some ideas going.

One of the goals of this pre-assignment was to work with a colleague on ideation and "bodystorming".
Unfortunately, I couldn't start the module until late this month, so I ended doing the idea prompting, moodboards and storyboard by myself after watching many videos on Twitter from XR Giants.
Still, since there were many firsts here (ShapesXR, storyboarding, moodboarding) - it was great to actually do it and work through it to grasp the tools and techniques accordingly.

### Problem Statement

I have thought of 3 prompts: 
- Smart Appliances Global Controller
- Check Electrical plugs and appliances (and decide what to turn on/off using the smart glasses or analogically) 
- Virtual Bowls or AppMarks: places where you drop apps around your home (example: your TV controller should be next to the TV, recipes in the kitchen)

I ended going for the Virtual Bowls/AppMarks (derived from bookmarks, but for 3D models/spatial apps). 
The reason might be a nostalgic feeling - of opening a container, or a drawer and see what you have in store - in a computer you kind of lost that. In addition, AppMarks can be a collaborative shared space in a way - an example: if you want to watch the same show as another person - you should have only one TV controller.

And it doesn't have to a bowl: it can be a book/magazine shelf (if you want to store your books/magazines to read later), or a vhs/dvd stand (for your youtube videos or actual films that you wish to get back to). 

I think it can be good to bring a bit of a nostalgia to our shared digital spaces - and our home (usually) tends to be a place where we share things. Plus seemed simple and fun.

***Update after submission***

I made this video showcasing my moodboard and storyboard in ShapesXR, with a Holonote.

### Process Achievements

- Completed the challenges mentioned above (brainstorming, moodboarding, storyboarding, bodystorming in ShapesXR)
- Moodboarding and initial storyboarding idea in Figma (see images below)
- In ShapesXR: 
  - Imported figma sections into the ShapesXR space, by using Integration Tokens
  - established background objects (my figma boards) - to make sure they were locked within the space
  - placed 2 viewpoints (one in the sofa, the other in front of the figma boards)
  - imported 3D objects into ShapesXR (like the Buddah statue).
  - used many features: snapping to object, group objects, duplicate objects between stages 
  - created many stages between each part to tell a story
  - Used Interactable menu (beta): tell the story using stages, each stage was activated by gaze/pinch (or delay in case of portraying animations)
  - (after submitting) adding Holonote talking about the moodboard and storyboard

The end result is the video in the header.

Below, you can review my figma boards.
