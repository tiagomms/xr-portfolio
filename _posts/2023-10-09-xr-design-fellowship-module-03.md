Here is a glimpse of what I have learned during Module 03 of the XR Design Fellowship program!

## Glimpse of our module: XR Worldbuilding & Environmental Storytelling 

In this module, we looked at XR design through a different lens of worldbuilding and environmental storytelling. XR Design Fellowship goal for this module was for us to set up our first workflow using tools for XR environment design, and understand the practices of environment design through worldbuilding and prototyping.

In spatial computing environment storytelling is extremely important because through the surroundings of what we create users may or not interact/understand our application. In the end, **strategically crafting a thoughtful and engaging XR environment can result in a drastically improved UX by mediating user behaviors**.

Our project was to create a XR museum experience. Instead of that, I tried to provide value to the NGO TUMO for which I am currently working for part-time. TUMO has developed an innovative education system for teenagers to learn STEM activities after school hours. And I tried designing a way to provide world class workshops for teenagers in remote regions. You can find more information and see the project development in these two posts:
- [Pre-Assignment: What is TUMO & TUMO Box mockup creation](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-pre-assign/)
- [Post-Assignment: TUMO Box: Design Idea for Remote set up & provision of Workshop Sessions through XR glasses](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-post-assign/)

On Sep 20th we had an amazing live session with [Don Carson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-carson-447339/) (Art Director @ Mighty Coconut) in which he gave us a sense of how environmental storytelling is done in the industry from start to end.

## Live Session

[Don](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-carson-447339/) has worked in the theme park industry as a Disney Imagineer and video game industry art director for over 40 years. For more than 20 years, Don has defended that the skill base and values of each industry should intersect to provide greater entertainment. Unfortunately, they appeared to not see it as clearly as him. 
Thankfully with VR, and his work at Mighty Coconut, it appears things have finally begun to change.

Don gave us a live session similar to this one on youtube.

But if you just want to read out the notes I took, here they are:

- **Environment storytelling allows the audience to create their own narrative inside the space created.** It ends up being a job where the artists guide the audience through an experience (whether through a physical space, 2D drawings, a videogame or VR) based on the artists idea of placement
- When designing, the art is developed as a concept/informative design for the engineering team. Everything it can help to explain your vision is important.
  - Examples: The use of other views (from the audience, bird's eye view, ...) or text. 
  - **But most importantly, designers should always have the ability to have their eyes in the same level as the audience when designing to detect what looks odd or good.**
  - **The entire process should consider what the final experience should look like.** For this reason, every object should be placed where you want them to look.
- **With VR - in 10 seconds you known instantly what isn't working, and changes can be done now before they are too late and too expensive to change. VR enables you to see your model from eye, bird, or any level**
- The visceral experience of riding a digital attraction in VR is very similar to a physical. The only difference it lacked was the "rubbing" to those you are sharing the experience with.
- **If the development is made in VR, then the ideation, art concept, testing, prop placement should be done immediately in the medium - the development in VR is way more natural because we tend to use our bodies and hands just like in the real world.** 
- **It is very important the space give a sense of progression throughout the audience experience.** In case of Walkabout Minigolf, they have always 18 holes, therefore 18 scenes in which the players have a chance to stumble upon and think what the story might be (in addition to cutscenes).
- Every object should be placed where you want them to look. In case of Walkabout Minigolf, it is important every hole shape responds to the environment is set and the idea of the main story.
- Below I summarize the project stages and Don's conclusion.

### Environment Storytelling - Project stages:

For Mighty Coconut, the entire process of making a new course takes 9-12 months to complete. 
In the case of Mighty Coconut, they simultaneously work in several projects so that a new course is delivered every 6 weeks.

**From Don's experience, the usual problem in the production stage is that we tend to get siloed in our own fields and becomes difficult to see outside of it. It is very important that art, design and engineering team have a say throughout the project and work as an jazz ensemble (everybody gets to touch it and everybody gets to make a decision).** That is in the case in Mighty Coconut, as their work resembles more of film production than the classic videogame or theme park industries.

This is the current pipeline that Mighty Coconut uses:
- Concept / ideation & Sketching: 
  - in VR (90-120 mins) with colleagues they draw very basic doodle of the space
  - then in VR, then continue to spend the day refining.
  - they use AI as an aid (not replacement) to create a concept sheet, but do not build on those designs.
- Initial Modeling of the world & Set decision: where are the Scenes, and how the audience will move throughout the experience in accordance to the story 
  - in case of walkabout minigolf, deciding where the 18 holes will be, and what is the audience trajectory in the world space
- Concept & sketching each scene: main goal (hole), shape language, story
- Concept & sketching: assets (build an ark of assets)
- Modeling & Set decision: assets & initial prop placement
  - **originality doesn't mean you make all assets, purchasing is fine**. That is how Mighty Coconut started
  - prop placement with charm is very important, because it helps tell a story
  - **in VR, low-poly with charm is the wisest decision. The more low-poly your objects are, the more objects you can insert in a scene, and the more you are able to tell**
- Modeling & Set decision: Rough Modeling (Scene, world)
  - the art of creating 3D assets in VR is more human, natural - it always allows you to jump into scale, and you can use your hands instead of an axis to tweak
- Modeling & Set decision: Drawovers
  - only now, we will be adding depth and decoration to the model that we know that is going to work
- Modeling & Set decision: Model refinement
  - optimising plays a very important role 
- Modeling & Set decision: Set decoration 
  - **Mighty Coconut uses a technique of a white room of assets (it reminds me of memory palace), in which they pick, duplicate, scale, move and rotate assets to create a scene**
  - all assets are hand placed, and finessed by eye: like adding furniture to a doll house
  - the goal is to finish optimisation of the model, put all the props; but no atmosphere, lights yet
  - **focus is always the same: everything works, everything supports the story**
- Lighting & Tech Art: 
  - Scene Prep & Polish - Color, Graphic Design In world
    - storyboards, and color palettes to begin setting the atmosphere & make art props (flyers, indicators, ...)
  - Scene Prep & Polish - Lighting & Shaders (with the engineering team)
  - Scene Prep & Polish - Final
- QA & Release
  - Teasers & Merch related to the story


### Conclusion

Paraphrasing Don's presentation and life work: 

> **1) It is possible to use the design principles for creating physical storytelling environments in the virtual world. As the tools and the means of distributing virtual content improve, I believe we will see an increased blurring of the lines between these two forms of placemaking.**

Both theme park and video game industry have similar goals and skill base. The main consideration they both have is to make sure the audience is drawn to the experience. 

There are of course differences: 
- in virtual environments we worry about CPU/Poly counts; 
  - but don't worry about safety, construction costs, or our physical location usually (we can work remotely)
- the main difference is method of consumption (physical/virtual)

> 2) As world builders we need to be flexible about what tools we use, and need to avoid defining yourselfs by those same tools.

For me, this was one of the most interesting conclusions (yet unexpected) because, during the whole presentation we saw how many tools Don has worked throughout his career to convey the images, models, visions and ideas he had. And most importantly, thanks to the new tools available (in comparison with those from his early days) the improvement over time of his art and models made, and how much more information is passed to the engineering teams.

At end of the day, it always takes time to learn, but to serve creation and the passage of ideas is to accept what comes, and what is needed. Every tool we learn and people we meet may help us unlock a bit more of ourselves that we didn't know, and help others unlock a part of themselves too. Plus, and thankfully, the newer tools are enabling us more and more to develop things in a digital space in a more natural way.

Don concluded his presentation with something we wrote in early 2000's and that it still rings true today:

![Don's remark in early 2000]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xr-bootcamp/xr-design-fellowship/module/03/don-rhetoric.png)

It is definitively a great mindset to follow and perhaps one day, we may achieve the blurring of the physical and digital through art, creativity with a whole lot of humanity.

## Assignments

As mentioned earlier, both assignments have their own post. Check them out:
- [Pre-Assignment: What is TUMO & TUMO Box mockup creation](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-pre-assign/)
- [Post-Assignment: TUMO Box: Design Idea for Remote set up & provision of Workshop Sessions through XR glasses](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-post-assign/)

## Personal Thoughts

If you have seen my assignments, I perhaps went a bit off-topic on this module. 
But through ShapesXR, I tried in my limited time to convey a sense of how education could change in remote areas. The lessons we received from Don and hopefully this project can be the start of great things to come. 

I can say Don was an amazing lecturer and inspired all of us. He provided a lot of great feedback. It was a privilege to learn so much from him. 

Once again, thank you to the XR Design Fellowship team, and Don for this incredible module!

### Side-note

My thoughts and prayers go to the people in the region of Nagorno-Karabach and Armenia in this difficult time. 

I hope that our work at TUMO may help many teenagers worldwide, and bring a light of empathy, love and dignity to every person learning and making the world a better place.

If you wish to understand more of the conflict at hand, I recommend this [article from NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/opinion/nagorno-karabakh-russia-turkey.html).
