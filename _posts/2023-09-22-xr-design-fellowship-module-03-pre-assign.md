## 01. Module 03 Pre-Assignment - Worldbuilding for XR Experience: TUMO Box Mockup creation

You may experience the assignment in ShapesXR if you want - [click here](https://shapes.app/space/view/72a6fb6b-f2e5-4aa3-ba9c-22aa843a2fb4/7da5ez55).  

For more information on the module, please check the main article coming soon [Module 03 - Worldbuilding for XR Experience](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03/).

This assignment has a second part - please check it out to see the final product - [Post-Assignment](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-post-assign/)!

### Challenge

*A museum client is asking your design studio to create an XR experience with one of the following objectives.*

- *Improve visitor engagement and/or learning*
- *Deliver museum content to worldwide XR users over the Internet*

*They will be satisfied as long as you succeed in one or both of the objectives.*

### Discovery Process

At first, I was thinking in making a Museum on Schooling & Education, because Education is a passion of mine and the reason why I became a XR Developer.

But this month I went to Armenia because we are opening the first TUMO center in Portugal - [TUMO Coimbra](https://coimbra.tumo.pt). So I changed the project idea to **Museums-through-the-Cloud**.

For those that don't know what [TUMO](https://tumo.org/whatistumo) is, TUMO is a NGO based in Armenia with the goal of providing free-of-charge top-notch self-learning and project-based education for all teenagers in their spare time. Most recently, they began expanding their TUMO centers worldwide - and the first center in Portugal will open in my hometown Coimbra. I will work as workshop leader in game development. 

During the week I was in Armenia, our team led by [Filipa Cunha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipasantoscunha/) visited the global headquarters and had intensive training in how TUMO works and what is expected from each of us. I believe all of us left in love with the project.

There are so many interesting things to discuss about TUMO, but one of the most inspiring parts of the project are the **TUMO boxes. For remote locations in Armenia, they are setting up containers with Internet access, solar panels and computers in which groups of teenagers can make their self-learning activities in their favourite modules**. Once they complete a set of activities they have free transportation from the Box to the nearest center (in a city nearby) to have Workshops with Industry Leaders. In the end of these workshops, the students have projects that are included in an online portfolio and they can show them to anyone.

Their ultimate goal is by 2026 to make sure a 60000 Armenian teenagers (a third approximately) are enrolled in a TUMO center at a time. With this goal completed, it should be possible that all teenager armenians can be part of TUMO at least once and begin their innovative STEM portfolio (the program usually takes 2-3 years to complete, and teenagers have 6/9 years to enter in the school).

I wondered about **how we can expand learning for boxes that are too far away from other main centers, and could these Boxes become learning centers for the remaining population. This is specially important for TUMO International projects in extremely poor and remote locations, that may not have industry leaders nearby.** 

And that is what I focused on this assignment.

### Development

#### Part 01 - Worldbuilding and Concept Development

> Think about a museum experience about a topic that you are obsessed with, or one that you have experienced yourselves or dreamed about. What kind of world is/was the experience resembling?

Before going to Armenia, I was thinking in making a Museum on Schooling & Education. 

After going to Armenia, I imagined my client was TUMO. I thought of these 2 propositions:

- **In TUMO Boxes, could we set up Museums-through-the-Cloud with XR Headsets?**
- **If yes, how would they work?**

The first step of the project was to make a Concept Development using a [FigJam template](https://www.figma.com/file/xql8cEvDl0z7c2GEMN6NDY?locale=en&type=design) provided by XR Bootcamp & Don Carson. It probably made more sense, for the Museum on Schooling & Education, but I ended up with 2 iterations.

Here is what I ended up writing / thinking.

<div class="responsive-video-container">
  <div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="padding-top: 56.25%;">
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FF7e0SDiIKqeQzYyZjK52na%2FMuseums-through-the-Cloud---Module-3-Worldbuilding-Template%3Ftype%3Dwhiteboard%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26t%3DA9YSAdx5tvW3Dxkm-1" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

In the end, this was my conclusion: 

**Since the TUMO Boxes tend to have similar layouts with the same dimensions/shapes (a computer room, entrance, so on), if they had a "white" room (room without anything around) - it could become the place where museums come true.**

**The similar setup of all boxes make them an interesting case for pop-up museums that can be set remotely, in which the staff in charge of the box have the responsability of maintaining the XR devices clean, and the experiences can be setup remotely.**

#### Part 02 - Designing and Prototyping

For the first part of the pre-assignment, I made **Model-based Environment Crafting** using [ShapesXR](http://shapes.app). 

I made my own TUMO Box, set it up in a mountainous region in Armenia, with local teenagers arriving in a local bus van.

In ShapesXR:
- Imported the low-poly terrain model below to make the countryside. 
- From Figma, Imported the photos of a real TUMO box close to Gyumri and a Mandalorian Recording Set in which they used 360 circular mega-screen for total immersion.
- Placed a holonote explaining the project
- 5 viewpoints: 3 outside, 1 in the TUMO Box entrance, 1 in the computer room
- Took screenshots and made a video for all of you to see (see gallery below).

### Next steps and Thoughts

For next steps, I actually went a bit off-course after our mentorship session with Don Carson! See my [Post-Assignment](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-post-assign/)!

And watch my post on this month's module to know what we learned - [Module 03 - Worldbuilding for XR Experience](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03/).

### Side-note

Our thoughts and prayers from TUMO Coimbra go to the people in Artsakh and Armenia in this difficult time. 

We hope that our work at TUMO may help many teenagers worldwide, and bring a light of empathy, love and dignity to every person learning and making the world a better place.
