## 02. Module 04 Assignment - Designing Multi-User XR Experiences: Memoir - Where Memories Go

![Where Memories Go]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xr-bootcamp/xr-design-fellowship/module/04/where_memories_go-selfie.png)

For more information on the module, please check the main article [Module 04 - Designing Multi-User XR Experiences](../xr-design-fellowship-module-04/).

You may experience the assignment in ShapesXR if you want, click below. I accept all of the feedback to help me improve and become a better XR prototyper.

### Challenge

Since the design of a multi-user experience is challenging to start, we focused on analysis and ideation before prototyping. This month's assignment was divided in 2 parts.

***Part 1***

- With the whole XR Bootcamp cohort make an affinity diagram about collaborative experiences in your daily life. 
- Ideate: Pick at least three collaborative or social experiences, such as jam sessions, conferences, concerts, townhalls, table-top games, sports, etc.
  - Document how the multi-user XR versions of them might look like. Think about the proxemics, locomotion design, interpersonal interactions, and anything critical to your design.
  - Present your ideas to this month's expert: [Paul Hoover - Head of Design for ShapesXR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pahoover)

***Part 2 (Prototype after live lecture critique)***

- Pick one of the ideas you created in the pre-assignment (or new ones).
- Prototype a multi-user experience in ShapesXR.
- Apply the new insights and techniques learned during the lecture to enhance the functionality, usability, and visual appeal of your prototype.

### Part 1 - Affinity Diagram and Ideate

The 3 ideas I raised:
- **Holiday Planner with family/friends**: app that provides means of discussion around maps and some recommendations, and immerse people in spaces they would like to visit
- **XR Remote workshop sessions to help teenagers on STEM modules**: Based on [my post assignment from module 03 - TUMO Box]((../xr-design-fellowship-module-03-post-assign/)), I began thinking about how to provide world class education for teenagers in remote locations through the use of XR glasses.
- **Where Memories Go: Place to grief and celebrate in family**: If people were remote and couldn't join in a moment of sharing, pain, sadness but most of all love, VR could be a great means to talk and share memories of their loved ones. 

Paul believed **Where Memories Go** had more potential and was way less complex, and could actually be done now. The most important parts to focus were: 
- async interactions (dropping memories, photos, voice, avatars); 
- then have a sync method when everyone would come along and share

He told me to see this app: [Where thoughts go? - for Meta Quests](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2406880882663555/).

Below, you can see a small screenshot of our cohort affinity diagram.

And the google doc where I collected all ideas.

### Part 2 - Prototype

I personally had a bad month, so most of this work was done during a weekend. 
There are a lot of tiny loose ends, but I tried to simplify and convey an image of how the app would work.

As mentioned before, the idea of **Memoir - Where Memories Go** was to give a chance to people to join remotely in their own spaces to celebrate or grief with their closed ones. The whole prototype was done in Figma and ShapesXR.

#### Moments

I envisioned 3 main moments for this app:
- **Create Memory (async)** - choose spaces, add models, portals, draw murals, etc...
- **Sync event with loved ones** - everyone gathers and visits those places for social interaction
- **Past Memories (async)** - revisit on your own

You can see them again on the video below.

In case you are interested, the quick UI mockups were made in Figma based on the [Float Grid Template](https://docs.floatgrids.com/getting-started/overview). You can see them in more detail below.

#### Spaces & 3D Objects

Besides considering the moments when users would go to the app, it was very important to think in the way the meeting spaces and 3D objects would influence the users in these experiences (the sort of things we discussed on [Module 03 on Environment Storytelling!](../xr-design-fellowship-module-03/)).

For users, already pre-configured spaces was an obvious choice to reflect many types of mood. But being able to upload a space (hardcore users), or bring a digital twin of a certain space makes total sense - especially a digital twin: like the old family fireplace or table. **The MR aspects, even though discussed by Paul in this month's live session - I didn't have time to think about it**.

Regarding the 3D objects, their functionality and aesthetics should reflect on what that people normally use/look to in moments of gried or celebration, and give them a purpose in VR. These are the main ones I considered:

- *Photo Album*: people around it would see the media (photos, and videos) at the same time. They should be able to grab photos and show them to others. Ocasionally, can cast the media to a cinema screen. The sound should be very local. This media would be uploaded from a web dashboard, like ShapesXR
- *Cinema Screen*: global screen for everyone to hear and see (2D sound)
- *Speaker*: boombox (outdoor) or vinyl player (indoor) where people may select the playlist
- *Camera*: to take mementos within the virtual space with a fixed camera that you see and move around. These are revealed as polaroids in a box. You should be able to select if it is selfie mode (sync everyone sees the screen), or only you see it.
- *Memory Orb*: ideally it should possible to record 360o moments or Holonotes inside the space for later review. 
- *Brush*: to paint around 
- *Microphone*: if there is a need to speak to everyone in a space
- *Picture Frame*: like a photo album but of a single media object
- *Portal door*: doors that link to other spaces
- *Trash*: probably there may be a need to delete things 
- *Memento Box*: box with all the memories (photo album, orbs, polaroid). Allows to visualize things in their own "UI screen", but can still hear everyone if needed (maybe except when person is in an orb). 
- *Basic Games*: 
  - if there are Pets - throw a ball, pet him, things like that. 
  - Simple games like chess make sense.


### Feedback

This was the feedback I got from our top expert - Paul Hoover. The main thing was the creation of mementos could be done also before the event (as surprises or something like it) and it makes total sense. 

At the time I had separated the video in 2 parts - but with his feedback I realized it was best to have just one bigger video.

Thank you Paul :)

### Next steps

- Improve UI - add images detailing spaces or objects. 
- Understand 'Where Thoughts Go' VR experience, and ShapesXR to develop a coherent UI & UX
- Improve and think more deeply on each of these 3D objects. Use ShapesXR to prototype more closely.
- Add middle UI screens 
- Have some sort of Lobby between the spaces as *[Common Areas to the Heart pattern](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl129.htm)* and a *[Social Gradient](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/01/21/social_gradient)*

### Thank yous

I didn't make any 3D Model or Space, although some of them I made a few minimal changes in Blender and ShapesXR. 
Thank you for everyone that took their time making these assets and posted them in turbosquid or sketchfab.

### Last Note

*This project idea came on the passing of my dog Lucas Jr. These works are never enough for a person or family grieving, but I felt his smile and warmth when putting his photos on the screen and putting a collar in a 3D dog.*

*Lucas - thank you, you were wonderful*.
